Get_Next_Line - 'read' is too easy
____

Concepts covered:
- Understanding 'read'
- Buffer management
- Static variables
- Linked lists
- Optimizing your code for speed and conciseness
- Memory management
... and making sure segfaults never happen!
Get_next_line returns the next line from a file, which is really useful for parsing. The actual return value is 1 if a line has been read, 0 if the reading is completed or -1 if an error has occurred.

This function can handle multiple file descriptors and only uses one static variable (bonus challenges).
